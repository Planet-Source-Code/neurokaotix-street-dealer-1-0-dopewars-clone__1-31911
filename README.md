### Description

This is a pretty cool looking DopeWars clone based on the FoodWars program submited on this site a while back. Its nearly complete and has a tight interface. It basically demostrates basic encryption, the use of the RND function, and a couple other things that you might want to look through. Its well commented and is pretty simple and eay to follow. Have fun!
